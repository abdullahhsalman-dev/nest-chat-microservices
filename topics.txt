Decorators: 
- In NestJS, decorators are special functions that are used to attach metadata to classes, methods, properties, or parameters
@Controller('books') // This decorator maps the route '/books'
@Get() // GET route for fetching all books


- Strategy: 
The strategy pattern is useful because it allows you to define multiple algorithms (or approaches) 
for a specific task and encapsulate them in separate classes
Common Use Cases for Strategies in NestJS:
Authentication: You might have different authentication strategies, such as JWT, OAuth2, or session-based authentication.

Payment Processing: Different payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) can be used based on user selection.

File Uploading: You can define different file storage strategies (local storage, cloud storage, etc.) based on user configuration.
