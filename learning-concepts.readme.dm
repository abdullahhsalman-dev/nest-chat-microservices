Network Types:

- Bridge default network driver create the interval private network on the host machine
- overlay  connect multiple demons and enable swarm to communicate
- Host : remove network isolation between container and host.


in docker-compose.yml

networks:
  chat-network:
    driver: bridge

You've defined a custom bridge network called chat-network
All your services are connected to this network


Network Analysis for Your Setup
docker network ls

Network Creation:

Docker Compose has created a network named nest-chat-microservices_chat-network (seen in your docker network ls output)
This is your custom chat-network prefixed with the project name

    1. API Gateway
Role: Acts as the entry point for client HTTP requests.

Responsibilities:

Receives HTTP requests from clients.

Forwards requests to appropriate microservices via RabbitMQ.

Handles user authentication and authorization.

Aggregates responses from microservices and sends them back to clients.

2. User Service
Role: Manages user-related operations.

Responsibilities:

Handles user registration and login.

Manages user profiles and authentication tokens.

Communicates with the User Queue via RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing.

3. Chat Service
Role: Manages chat-related functionalities.

Responsibilities:

Handles creation and management of chat rooms.

Manages chat messages within rooms.

Communicates with the Chat Queue via RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing.

4. Message Service
Role: Handles message-related operations.

Responsibilities:

Processes incoming chat messages.

Stores and retrieves messages from the database.

Communicates with the Message Queue via RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing.

Communication Flow
Client Request: A client sends an HTTP request to the API Gateway.

API Gateway:

Authenticates the request.

Determines the appropriate microservice to handle the request.

Publishes a message to the relevant RabbitMQ queue (e.g., User Queue, Chat Queue, or Message Queue).

Microservice:

Listens to its designated RabbitMQ queue.

Processes the message asynchronously.

Interacts with the database if necessary.

Sends a response back to the API Gateway via RabbitMQ.

API Gateway:

Aggregates the response from the microservice.

Sends the final response back to the client.
